# The why: makepkg requires to be run as an un-previleged user. ...even for a 'makepkg --printsrcinfo' operation.
# The `build` user created in this container may have a UID mismatch with the GHA host.
# GH Actions do not currently support supplying build-arg values to the container, which would be a traditional
# way to solve this problem.
# The majoirity of "Arch Makepkg" actions on the marketplace address this issue by a compbinaiton of
# messing with file permissions of the checked out repo, or by copying the repo to a new location.
#
# In the alternate, We shall attempt to re-create the "user-ns keepId" behaviour here:
# 1. compare the UID of the `build` user in the container with the effective permissions of the WORKDIR
# 2. in the case of a mismatch, sudo-provision a new user with the same UID as the WORKDIR's owning UID
# 3. run the following 'makefile' and 'repo' operations as the new user.
